Policies and considerations in policy design, if based on data, will obviously take into account the 
information of the population for whom data exist. 
Without data, therefore, it is hard to design policies that may be useful in addressing policy-areas of concern. 

### Seasonal unemployment rates by race/ethnicity (Aug 2016 - Aug 2017)

The plot below shows seasonal unemployment rates by race/ethnicity. Note that the 'All White' 
category includes non-Caucasians that maybe of Hispanic/Latino
origin. It is not straight forward to remove the Hispanic/Latino group from the 'All White' category. 
For demonstration purposes, I left the groups as the are.

Unequal distribution of wealth, burden of diseases and mortality has been observed for generations. 
There are several sources for these differences. Differences in occupational status is one of the sources.

I first became interested in disparities research after taking a quantitative health research class where I 
was exposed to differences in how people from different race/ethnic backgrounds interacted with the healthcare system.

In my dissertation, I looked at the direct and indirect relationships of socioeconomic status (SES) factors to 
health status and healthcare services utilization. Until I looked at the literature and reports, I did not realize 
the great wealth disparities by race/ethnicity. Further, educational achievement and income disparities are huge. 
Because the data I used was for older Americans, the gap in employment status did not appear to be large. 
So, I was curious about employment/unemployment rates over time given official governemnt data. Obviously, employment, 
education, income, wealth and health are related but this relationship maybe different for different groups. 
This post bearks down unemployment rates over time by race/ethnicity & gender where possible.

### Seasonally adjusted unemployment rates by Race/Ethnicity

The figure plots unemployment rates for White, Black, Hispanic/Latino and Asian groups. Note that the "All White" 
category includes Whites that maybe of Hispanic/Latino origin. It would seem that Asians have lower unemployment 
rates than Caucasian Whites but once the Latino/Hispanic group is removed from the "All White" group, unemployment 
rates among Caucasian Whites is likely lower than observed. What is interesting in this figure is that unemployment 
rates among Hispanic/Latino groups is much lower than unemployment rates among Black/African Americans given the assertions 
that both groups are disadvantaged.

### A Time Series Plot of Unemployment Rates by Race/ethnicity (2007 - 2017) 
#### What would a plot of unemployment rates for 10 years look like for White, Black and Asian groups?

Unemployment rates for Black/African American groups is almost always two times higher than that of Asians and Whites. 
You can also observe that month to month changes in unemployment are higher in the Asian and Black groups. Why?

Despite the wide perception (& actual gains in many aspects of life for minorities) about improved experience regarding 
employment, wealth accumulation, health disparity, prosperity, and maybe egalitarianism, published indicators show consistent 
lag for minorities in general but for Blacks/African Americans in particular. There was no parity, and there is no parity in 
unemployment rates by Race/Ethnic groups in the last 10 year unemployment trends. Question is: will there ever be parity in 
unemployment rates by race/ethnicity?
