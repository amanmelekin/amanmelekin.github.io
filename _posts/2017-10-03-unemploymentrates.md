In this post, I quickly wanted to look at some plots comparing unemployment rates by race/ethnicity and gender.
I will start by comparing unemployment rates for men. The data for the Asian group were not broken down by gender, so this group is dropped from the plots in this post.

- **Unemployment rates by Race/Ethnicity for men**

Once again, unemployment rates among Black/African America men is higher than their White and Hispanic counterparts! Remember the graph for Whites includes the Hispanic/Latino group, and so, in fact, would show unemployment rates for Caucasian Whites to be lower than shown by the "All White" plots.

- **Unemployment rates by Race/Ethnicity for women**

Adjusted unemployment rates are similarly worse for Black/African American women which is considerably higher than unemployment rates for Whites. But, Hispanic/Latino women appear to be doing better than their male counterparts.

- **Unemployment rates by Race/Ethnicity & gender**

Combining the two plots above provides the plot below for quick visual comparison by race/ethnicity & gender.

Looking at the plot comparing race/ethnicity by gender clearly shows consistent higher unemployment rates for Black/African Americans. Latino/Hispanic males fared better than their female counterparts up until the present administration's 6th month of the first year! The disparity between female/male unemployment for Whites (again this includes All Whites), does not appear to indicate huge discrepancy.
