Hello, thanks for visiting!   

My interests are wide & include: 
- Social systems 
- Methods &
- Applied statistics  

to study group differences emerging from varoius systems and mechanisms driving the emergence of such differences.  

I am also interested in Data Science, & Systems Philosophy as a disciple of 
[Dr. Martin Zwick](https://www.pdx.edu/sysc/faculty-martin-zwick) (Portland State University).
